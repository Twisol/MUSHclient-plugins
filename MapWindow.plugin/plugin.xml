MapWindow v3.0
By Rollanz, based on Soludra's MapWindow v2.001
By Soludra Ar'thela

This plugin is best used alongside my ATCP plugin. Its messages allow
the MapWindow to update every time you move, even by summons or other
"nonstandard" means.

Commands:
MAP RADIUS <1-5>
-> Sets the MAP radius, which affects the mapwindow size.
-> MAP WIDTH and MAP HEIGHT also work as expected.

MAP MOVE
-> Displays the current map-window location

MAP MOVE <x> <y>
-> Positions the map window in a specific location on the screen.
-> 0 0 is the top-left corner.

MAP FONTSIZE <font size>
-> Sets the size each symbol takes up.
-> Default is 10. Is not yet saved between sessions.

MAP PARSE
-> Updates the map with MAP, gagging the output.
-> You shouldn't need to use this yourself unless you
-> don't have the ATCP plugin installed.
